This function\n must be called before any calls to kmalloc() - not creating a task,\n queue, semaphore, mutex, software timer, event group, etc. will result in\n kmalloc being called.\n\n pxHeapRegions passes in an array of HeapRegion_t structures - each of which\n defines a region of memory that can be used as the heap.  The array is\n terminated by a HeapRegions_t structure that has a size of 0.  The region\n with the lowest start address must appear first in the array.","declarations":[{"spell":"105:6-105:28|-1|1|1","param_spellings":["105:57-105:70"]}],"bases":[],"derived":[],"vars":[],"uses":[],"callees":[]},{"id":2,"usr":984491213930704906,"detailed_name":"void *kmalloc(size_t xSize)","short_name_offset":6,"short_name_size":7,"kind":12,"storage":1,"hover":"","comments":"\n Map to the memory management routines required for the port.","declarations":[{"spell":"111:7-111:14|-1|1|1","param_spellings":["111:23-111:28"]}],"bases":[],"derived":[],"vars":[],"uses":[],"callees":[]},{"id":3,"usr":17538964900135605611,"detailed_name":"void kfree(void *pv)","short_name_offset":5,"short_name_size":5,"kind":12,"storage":1,"hover":"","comments":"","declarations":[{"spell":"112:6-112:11|-1|1|1","param_spellings":["112:19-112:21"]}],"bases":[],"derived":[],"vars":[],"uses":[],"callees":[]},{"id":4,"usr":1669765115260427506,"detailed_name":"void vPortInitialiseBlocks()","short_name_offset":5,"short_name_size":21,"kind":12,"storage":1,"hover":"","comments":"","declarations":[{"spell":"113:6-113:27|-1|1|1","param_spellings":[]}],"bases":[],"derived":[],"vars":[],"uses":[],"callees":[]},{"id":5,"usr":3562140898138900815,"detailed_name":"size_t xPortGetFreeHeapSize()","short_name_offset":7,"short_name_size":20,"kind":12,"storage":1,"hover":"","comments":"","declarations":[{"spell":"114:8-114:28|-1|1|1","param_spellings":[]}],"bases":[],"derived":[],"vars":[],"uses":[],"callees":[]},{"id":6,"usr":15207790851929837490,"detailed_name":"size_t xPortGetMinimumEverFreeHeapSize()","short_name_offset":7,"short_name_size":31,"kind":12,"storage":1,"hover":"","comments":"","declarations":[{"spell":"115:8-115:39|-1|1|1","param_spellings":[]}],"bases":[],"derived":[],"vars":[],"uses":[],"callees":[]},{"id":7,"usr":2558806302436073260,"detailed_name":"int32_t xPortStartScheduler()","short_name_offset":8,"short_name_size":19,"kind":12,"storage":1,"hover":"","comments":"\n Setup the hardware ready for the scheduler to take control.
